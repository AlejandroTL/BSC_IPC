## AUTOENCODER

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise” (Wikipedia).

Pytorch is the library used. First tests are done with MNIST dataset.
